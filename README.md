# RMarkdown Sandbox

## R could make a website? I'm in.

Hello! I'm **Faiz**, a Computer Science student and also a web development enthusiast.

I've found out about RMarkdown and it can make a website! So why not try? This site is my attempt to try and learn more about web development, which is a very wide world.

  For more information about simple R Markdown websites, please read the documentation at <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html>.

Please also note that simple R Markdown sites are *not* based on **blogdown**. They are probably good for websites with only a few Rmd documents. For larger-scale and more sophisticated websites (such as blogs), you may want to use **blogdown** instead: <https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown>.
